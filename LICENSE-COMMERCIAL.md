## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this for free?

Yes! The AGPL-3.0 license allows free use. If you modify the code and offer it as a network service (SaaS), you must make your modifications available under AGPL-3.0.

### What if I just use it locally with Claude?

Personal, local use is free under AGPL-3.0. No commercial license required.

### What if my company uses it internally?

Internal use within a company (not offered as a service to others) is typically fine under AGPL-3.0. A commercial license is only needed if you're distributing or offering the software to third parties.

### What counts as "modifications"?

Changes to the source code, configurations that alter behavior when distributed, or derivative works. Simply using the software with your own vault doesn't count as modification.

### Can I get a discount for open source projects?

Open source projects using a compatible copyleft license can use AGPL-3.0 directly. For open source projects that need a permissive license, contact us.
